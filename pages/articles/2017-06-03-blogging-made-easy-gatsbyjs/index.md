I've been meaning to start a personal website and blog for quite some time. I've finally gotten around with it to play around with <a href='https://github.com/gatsbyjs' target='__blank'>Gatsby.js</a>, a simple static site generator utilizing React.js and Markdown that seems perfect for a simple personal blog.

This is a simple introductory post I'm currently using for testing this framework out.  Look for a subsequent post including step by step instructions on how I set this blog up and deployed it to AWS on a Sunday afternoon.
