I am a software engineer of 8+ years with a passion for building applications and systems from tip to tail.  I started my career writing object-oriented PHP for 4 years to support several large CMS and Salesforce-like applications in a LAMP environment. I then switched my focus to JavaScript when I discovered Node.js and was able to maneuver myself into a positiion to write Node full-time. I never was a fan of front-end Javascript code...browser idiosyncracies frustrated me to no end and all front-end "applications" I had been exposed to were a mess of spaghetti code.  This started changed as CommonJS became more common on the front-end with tools like Browserify and Webpack. I finally had the lightbulb moment and was able to write re-usable, modular front-end code. I didn't fall in love with front-end until React came on the scene. For the past several years I can say that I truly love being a full-stack javascript engineer.
